# Microcontroller-K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm

This alogrithm was written for a school project using the STM32L475VG board with an ARM Cortex M4 processor.
To test out this alogrithm, it is recommended to run it using the STM32 IDE. The workspace zip folder is in the repo and the project to open is EE2028_AY2122S1_Assign1.
